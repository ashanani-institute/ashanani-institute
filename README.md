The ASHANANI Institute explores the unified geometry of consciousness, coherence, and emergence.  
Our current research includes:

### 🔷 Universal Unity Theory (UUT)
A conceptual framework proposing coherence-based unification across geometry, field dynamics, information structure, and consciousness.

### 🔷 ASHANA Model
An applied framework connecting theoretical physics, somatic alignment, and human development into a single coherence-based system.

### 🔬 Research Focus Areas
- Unified geometry  
- Information coherence  
- Field dynamics  
- Consciousness + physics  
- Complexity + emergence  
- Somatic systems and alignment  

### 🎨 Art & Exhibitions  
Interactive installations inspired by theoretical models of coherence and the structure of the soul.

### 📄 Publications  
The UUT conceptual draft will be released on Zenodo in December 2025.  
More papers will follow as the theoretical structure formalizes mathematically.
